# Isometric Home with Interactive Objects and Controllable Cat

This project is an interactive web application built using vanilla JavaScript and spline app. It showcases an isometric home environment with various interactive objects and a controllable cat character. Users can explore the virtual home, interact with objects, and navigate the cat character throughout the scene.

## Features

- Isometric Home: The application presents an isometric view of a home environment, including a house, garden, and surrounding objects, rendered using HTML and CSS.

- Interactive Objects: Users can interact with various objects within the scene, such as doors, windows, furniture, and other elements. Clicking or tapping on an object triggers a specific action or animation.

- Controllable Cat: The cat character serves as the user's avatar within the environment. Users can control the cat's movement using keyboard or touch controls, allowing them to navigate through the scene freely.

- Spline Animation: The cat's movement is facilitated using spline animation techniques. Spline curves define the cat's path, resulting in smooth and natural movements as it travels through the environment.

- Event Handling: The application utilizes event handling to detect user interactions with objects and triggers corresponding actions. This allows for dynamic and responsive behavior when interacting with different elements in the scene.
